Introduction
--------------------------------------

We developed DTGN, a method to identify phenotype-specific transcriptional elements based on time-course gene expression data and TF-Gene network. 
This method uses the graph autoencoder (GAE) model to learn the temporal latent representation from time-course gene expression data and TF-Gene network,
and then employs the extended sample-specific network (SSN) method to construct dynamic TF-Gene networks. 
Finally, we utilize the dynamic TF-Gene networks to identify phenotype-specific transcriptional elements.
